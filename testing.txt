// functional tests

A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), 
or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, 
but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

------------------------------

When a user "has an empty shopping cart", then "the shopping icon should have a 0 to indicate an empty cart".

When a user "hovers their mouse on the shopping cart", then "a small container should show a list of items in the cart".

When a user "adds items to the shopping cart without logged in", then "the cart should still update and save changes".

When a user "adds items to the shopping cart while logged in", then "the cart should still update and save changes".

When a user "clicks on the shopping cart icon", then "move to the checkout page".

When a user "has items in cart and clicked on the shopping cart icon without logged in", then "promp the user to create an account or login in".

When a user "has items in cart and clicked on the shopping cart icon while logged in", then "go straight to checkout page".
